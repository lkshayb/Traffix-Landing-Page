# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
Intelligent Traffic Management System
!(https://www.google.com/search?q=https://placehold.co/800x400/2d3748/ffffff%3Ftext%3DTraffic%2BManagement%2BSystem)

An advanced traffic management system using YOLOv8, OpenCV, and Scikit-learn to analyze traffic flow, detect congestion, and provide real-time insights.

üåü Project Overview
This project offers a smart solution for urban traffic control. It processes video feeds to detect, track, and classify vehicles, using the collected data to calculate traffic density and speed. This enables more efficient traffic management, congestion prediction, and dynamic signal control.

‚ú® Key Features
Real-time Vehicle Detection: High-accuracy vehicle detection and classification using YOLOv8.

Vehicle Counting: Accurately counts vehicles passing through specified zones.

Traffic Flow Analysis: Measures traffic volume and speed to determine the flow rate.

Congestion Detection: Uses machine learning to identify congestion based on vehicle density and speed.

Data Visualization: Overlays bounding boxes, tracking IDs, and counts on the video feed for intuitive monitoring.

Scalable & Modular: Designed for easy extension with new features like license plate recognition.

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
Video Input: Captures video from files or live feeds using OpenCV.

Frame Preprocessing: Optimizes each frame for the detection model.

Object Detection: YOLOv8 identifies and locates vehicles within frames.

Object Tracking: Assigns a unique ID to each vehicle to track its movement across frames.

Data Analysis: Calculates vehicle count, speed, and traffic density from tracking data.

ML Inference: Scikit-learn models predict congestion levels from the analyzed data.

Output Visualization: Displays or saves the processed frame with data overlays.
